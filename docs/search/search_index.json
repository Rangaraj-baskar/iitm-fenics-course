These materials are presented in Jupyter Notebooks , which allow you to see both the code and its explanations, as well as the results, all together. The tutorials are comprehensive notebooks that demonstrate how to approach different types of problems using FEniCS. On the other hand, the exercises are meant to be interactive, and they encourage you to expand the notebooks by adding new functionalities. This way, you can develop your expertise in using FEniCS. If you just want to view the tutorials and exercises without making any changes, you can access them on on nbviewer without installing FEniCS.

Additionally, you have the option to either clone the repository or download the code from the provided link. What is FEniCS? FEniCS is a high-performance computing (HPC) capable tool that efficiently utilizes supercomputers and high-performance clusters to solve complex scientific problems. It supports parallel computing, JIT compilation, and integrates with PETSc and MPI for scalability and performance. Its HPC capabilities enable researchers to perform large-scale simulations and analyses effectively. FEniCS is an acronym FEniCS is an acronym that stands for \"Finite Element Computational Software.\" The inclusion of \"ni\" in the name is to create a balanced and appealing composition. The FEniCS software package was compiled at the University of Chicago, whose Phoenix mascot likely influenced the choice of the name.

You need Windows 10/11 Education or Professional for this to work. This does not work on Windows 10/11 Home. Docker Paraview CMDER (Only for Windows) (After installation, open cmder and then go to Settings(Win+Alt+P)\u27a1import and choose the cmlab.xml provided in the repository.) Google Chrome (After installation, open Chrome and paste the following in the address bar, chrome://flags/. In the flags screen, enable WebGL Developer Extensions ) Install FEniCS Once the docker system is installed and running, open CMDER/terminal and run: docker pull iitrabhi/fenics_notebook Running To start the notebook server, use the following: docker run -p 8888:8888 -v host_system_path:/root/ -w /root/ iitrabhi/fenics_notebook Note: you should replace the variable host_system_path with the path of the folder that contains your code. e.g., If D:\\Codes contains your code, then to start the command line interface, you have to run: docker run -p 8888:8888 -v D:\\Codes:/root/ -w /root/ iitrabhi/fenics_notebook Once you run the above command in cmder, you will get a URL starting with http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab . Press Control and click on the URL to open a new Jupyter Notebook. If you have Windows home You can use google collab to run FEniCS on the cloud.
